This repository showcases work for the Risk Management (230H) final project.

# Question
In respect with the recent rise in popularity of the website Robinhood, what is the effect of widespread amateur trading on stock prices? What are some implications thereof for risk management?

# Approach
We will examine whether the continuous increase of robinhood trades for some given stock led to new patterns in price series since the beginning of the coronavirus. We can investigate qualitatively whether stylized financial facts that are specific to the current financial crisis are due to widespread trading.
We could also inspect microscopic effects of Robinhood trading on single stocks.
Finally, we could create a representative portfolio for aggregated positions of robinhood traders, and analyze its risk properties. We can also investigate whether such a portfolio can serve as a risk factor.

# Data sources
